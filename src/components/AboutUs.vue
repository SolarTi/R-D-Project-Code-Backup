                  Verdantoff seeks to migrate office workers from the physical
                  environment to virtual environments via the Internet. This
                  will cut carbon emissions, reduce over-dependence on fossil
                  fuel and help freshen up the environment. The skills and
                  competence of office workers are in their minds, which means
                  they can perform their tasks wherever they are located,
                  including their homes, using laptops and desktops.
                </p>

                  Up to 92% of GDP in developed nations come from the service
                  sector. If this sector learns to migrate to virtual offices,
                  most of the problems of modern society will be solved,
                  especially traffic gridlock and housing shortages.
