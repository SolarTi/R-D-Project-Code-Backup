        <br>Last updated: 3 May 2022<br>
        <br>
        <p>
            This Frontier Technologies (FronTech) Customer Agreement (this “Agreement”) 
            contains the terms and conditions that govern your access to and use of the Service Offerings (as defined below) and is an agreement between 
            the applicable FronTech Contracting Party specified in Section 14 below (also referred to as “FronTech,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and you or 
            the entity you represent (“you” or “your”). This Agreement takes effect when you click an “I Accept” button or check box presented with these 
            terms or, if earlier, when you use any of the Service Offerings (the “Effective Date”). You represent to us that you are lawfully able to 
            nter into contracts (e.g., you are not a minor, and you are of sound mind). If you are entering into this Agreement for an entity, 
            such as the company you work for, you represent to us that you have legal authority to bind that entity. Please see Section 14 for 
            definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement.

            discontinue material functionality of a Service that you are using, or materially alter a customer-facing API that you are using in a backwards-incompatible 
            fashion, except that this notice will not be required if the 12 month notice period (a) would pose a security or intellectual property issue to us or the 
            Services, (b) is economically or technically burdensome, or (c) would cause us to violate legal obligations.
        </p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <p>
            4.3 Your Security and Backup.

            4.4 Log-In Credentials and Account Keys. FronTech log-in credentials and private keys generated by the Services are for your internal use only and you will not sell, transfer or sublicense them to any other entity or person, except that you may disclose your private key to your agents and subcontractors performing work on your behalf.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            4.5 End Users. You will be deemed to have taken any action that you permit, assist or facilitate any person or entity to take in relation to this Agreement, Your Content or use of the Service Offerings. You are responsible for End Users’ use of Your Content and the Service Offerings.

If you become aware of any violation of your obligations under this Agreement caused by an End User, you will immediately suspend access to Your Content and the Service Offerings by such End User. We do not provide any support or services to End Users unless we have a separate agreement with you or an End User obligating us to provide such support or services. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h6 class="text-2xl">5. Fees and Payment.</h6>
        <br>
        <p>
            5.1 Service Fees. We calculate and bill fees and charges monthly. We may bill you more frequently for fees accrued if we suspect that your account is fraudulent or at risk of non-payment. You will pay us the applicable fees and charges for use of the Service Offerings as described on the FronTech Site using one of the payment methods we support. All amounts payable by you under this Agreement will be paid to us without setoff or counterclaim, and without any deduction or withholding. Fees and charges for any new Service or new feature of a Service will be effective when we post updated fees and charges on the FronTech Site, unless we expressly state otherwise in a notice. We may increase or add new fees and charges for any existing Services you are using by giving you at least 30 days’ prior notice. We may elect to charge you interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) on all late payments.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            5.2 Taxes. Each party will be responsible, as required under applicable law, for identifying and paying all taxes and other governmental fees 
            and charges (and any penalties, interest, and other additions thereto) that are imposed on that party upon or with respect to the transactions 
            and payments under this Agreement. All fees payable by you are exclusive of Indirect Taxes, except where applicable law requires otherwise. We 
            may charge and you will pay applicable Indirect Taxes that we are legally obligated or authorized to collect from you. You will provide such information 
            to us as reasonably required to determine whether we are obligated to collect Indirect Taxes from you. We will not collect, and you will not pay, any 
            Indirect Tax for which you furnish us a properly completed exemption certificate or a direct payment permit certificate for which we may claim an 
            available exemption from such Indirect Tax. All payments made by you to us under this Agreement will be made free and clear of any deduction or 
            withholding, as may be required by law. If any such deduction or withholding (including but not limited to cross-border withholding taxes) is 
            required on any payment, you will pay such additional amounts as are necessary so that the net amount received by us is equal to the amount then 
            due and payable under this Agreement. We will provide you with such tax forms as are reasonably requested in order to reduce or eliminate the amount
            of any withholding or deduction for taxes in respect of payments made under this Agreement.

Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Service Offerings, or to any products or services sold or distributed by FronTech will be adjudicated in the Governing Courts, and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Governing Courts, subject to the additional provisions below.
            <br><br>(a) If the applicable FronTech Contracting Party is Frontier Technologies NZ Ltd, or Frontier Technologies Vietnam LLC, the parties agree that the provisions of this Section 13.5(a) will apply. Disputes will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The rules of arbitration in any governing jurisdiction will apply to this Agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered office: 616 Glenbrook Road, RD4 Pukekohe Auckland 2679 New Zealand. 
Arbitration proceedings under New Zealand law is governed by the Arbitration Act 1996. Payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the Arbitration Act 1996. We will reimburse those fees for claims totalling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. We will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or video conference, based on written submissions, or at a mutually agreed location. We and you agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we and you waive any right to a jury trial. Notwithstanding the foregoing we and you both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
            <br><br>(b) If the applicable FronTech Contracting Party is Frontier Technologies Africa Proprietary Limited, the parties agree that the provisions of this Section 13.5(b) will apply. Disputes will be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the then-applicable rules and judgment on the arbitral award must be entered in the Governing Court. The Arbitration Act provisions apply to this Agreement. The arbitration will take place in Johannesburg or Accra. There will be three arbitrators. The fees and expenses of the arbitrators and the administering authority, if any, will be paid in equal proportion by the parties.
            <br><br>(c) If the applicable FronTech Contracting Party is Frontier Technologies Brazil Ltd, the parties agree that the provisions of this Section 13.5(c) will apply. Disputes will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, in accordance with the then-applicable Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, and judgment on the arbitral award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitration will take place in the City of São Paulo, State of São Paulo, Brazil. There will be three arbitrators. The fees and expenses of the arbitrators and the administering authority, if any, will be paid in equal proportion by the parties. The parties agree that the existence of and information relating to any such arbitration proceedings will not be disclosed by either party and will constitute confidential information. The Governing Courts will have exclusive jurisdiction for the sole purposes of (i) ensuring the commencement of the arbitral proceedings; and (ii) granting conservatory and interim measures prior to the constitution of the arbitral tribunal.
